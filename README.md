# HydeSlides

HydeSlides is a template for making HTML slide decks using Jekyll, with RevealJS or ImpressJS.  [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) or clone this repository to get started!

## Building from Existing Chapters

Creating a new slide deck and building "chapter" content is easy:

1. Create a new directory for your chapter content under _posts
2. Save slides in Markdown within your chapter directory
3. Add YAML front matter with `layout` (required), `tags` (required), `title` (optional), and `chapters` (optional) fields

`layout` must be set to `slidedeck`; `title` can be whatever you like; `chapters` is a quoted, comma separated list matching the corresponding directory in _posts.

## Creating new Chapter Content

Example "chapter" content is located in the `_posts` directory. Markdown files are used for content and grouped into folders to make everything as human-readable as possible.

A chapter consists of a `_posts/<yourchapter>` folder and markdown files. Each markdown file must begin with four YAML front matter fields: `chapter`, `layout`, `title`, `tags`:

* `chapter` serves as the string for the auto-generated cover slide
* `layout` must set to `slidedeck`
* `title` must be a string or, to hide the slide header, an empty string, or "false"
* `tags` for simplicity sake is only assigned one value, usually the same name as the chapter folder

### Notes

Speaker notes, only shown on the "split" screen, are displayed by pressing the S key. They are included on slides in an HTML wrapped element with `class="notes"`:

	{% include hydeslides/notes-open %}
	  Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them
	  if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).
	{% include hydeslides/notes-close %}

### Slide Deck "What's Next" Feature

Pressing S will launch the slide deck with the "What's Next" feature (showing the next slide) alongside the presenter notes (if any notes are in the original slide markdown).

## Theming

Custom themes are forthcoming for HydeSlides.

## Dependencies 
* SASS theming is found under `/dependencies/theme/css` and controls all RevealJS and slide presentation overrides
* Graphical and JS dependencies are centrally stored in `/dependencies`
  * RevealJS is a Git submodule of HydeSlides, stored in `/dependencies/revealjs`
* Assets used throughout any slide deck should be stored in `/assets`

## Installation

Before you can use HydeSlides, you need to install the RevealJS submodule into your copy of HydeSlides:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

To run HydeSlides, you need to have already installed Ruby and Jekyll. To run HydeSlides you need only to run Jekyll in your HydeSlides repository:

```
jekyll serve --watch
```
